## Code Standards
To ensure consistency and quality in the code, the following standards are enforced:



### Naming Conventions
Naming should be consistent throughout the project, and most importantly ALWAYS BE DESCRIPTIVE... The following naming conventions should be used:
- **Component names / File names**: All component names should be in `PascalCase` (e.g. `MyComponent`).
- **Variable names**: All variable names should be in `camelCase` (e.g. `myVariable`).
- **Function names**: All function names should be in `camelCase` (e.g. `myFunction`).
- **Class names**: All class names should be in `PascalCase` (e.g. `MyClass`).
- **Interface names**: All interface names should be in `PascalCase` (e.g. `MyInterface`).
- **Enum names**: All enum names should be in `PascalCase` (e.g. `MyEnum`).
- **Enum members**: All enum members should be in `UPPER_CASE` (e.g. `MY_ENUM_MEMBER`).
- **Constants**: All constants should be in `UPPER_CASE` (e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`).
- **Short names**: Short names should be avoided unless they are very common (e.g. `i`, `j`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `z`), or makes sense (discuss with teammembers).

### Code Formatting
- **Indentation**: All code should be indented with 2 spaces.
- **Line length**: All lines should be no longer than 120 characters.
- **Semicolons**: All statements should end with a semicolon.
- **Quotes**: All strings should be in double quotes.
- **Braces**: All braces should be on the same line as the corresponding statement or declaration.
- **Parentheses**: All parentheses should be on the same line as the corresponding statement or declaration.
- **Commas**: All commas should be followed by a space.
- **Operators**: All operators should be surrounded by spaces.
- **Comments**: All comments should be in English and follow the [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) standard. if applicable.

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript or JS.
- **Imports**: All imports should be sorted alphabetically.
- **Variables**: All variables should be declared with `const` or `let`.
- **Functions**: All functions should be declared with `const`.
- **Classes**: All classes should be declared with `class`.
- **Interfaces**: All interfaces should be declared with `interface`.
- **Enums**: All enums should be declared with `enum`.

### Libraries/Utilities:
Libraries or utility files, should be written in `kebab-case`, this ensures its easy to see its either library or utility file.
- Example: `my-utility.ts`, `my-utility.js`


These conventions help maintain a consistent and understandable project structure, making it easier for developers to navigate and work with the codebase.
